    The full `sections` payload is the caller's, not the model's: nested corner objects
    and per-word boxes run to megabytes and would swamp the context. But handing the
    model no geometry at all is worse than it sounds -- asked for a document layout it
    has nothing to fill the bbox fields from, and the system prompt (rightly) forbids
    inventing coordinates, so the only honest answer left is an empty list. That is
    exactly what a layout request returned.

    Two views, each flattened to [x1,y1,x2,y2] with its page. `layout` is the layout
    detector's typed blocks -- title, paragraph, table, figure -- which is what a
    layout request asks for; handed only text lines, the model guessed which lines made
    a heading and drew one box per line. `lines` is each text line, for a question
    about one field -- a receipt's total sits inside one big block. Lines go in while
    they fit the cap; past it the model is told to OCR fewer pages for them.

    Opt-in, because it is not free. Attaching this to every OCR call added hundreds of
    blocks to requests that only wanted text, and the crowding measurably degraded
    them -- a word-extraction test dropped from 446 words to 392. The model asks for
    geometry when the request needs geometry.
