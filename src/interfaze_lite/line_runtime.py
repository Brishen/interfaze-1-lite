"""The line detector and layout detector, each engine in a process of its own.

They ran as one engine per thread, and threads share Paddle's oneDNN context, which is
process-wide. After each run a predictor counts that context's cached objects without
taking the lock other threads write it under (`OneDNNContext::GetCachedObjectsNumber`,
reached from `AnalysisPredictor::MkldnnPostReset`), and under concurrent OCR the process
segfaulted -- taking OCR, speech and diarization down with it until it restarted. A
process of its own gives each engine its own context, so there is nothing to race; and a
worker that does crash takes one call with it, which is retried, not the service.

Kept free of torch and of this package's other modules, so the worker processes start
with nothing but Paddle.
